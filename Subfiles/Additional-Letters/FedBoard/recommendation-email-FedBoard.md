Dear [firstname],

I'm reaching out to you on behalf of my student Will Du ([website](https://www.william-du.com)), who is on the Job Market and has applied for the position of Economist at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, because you're someone who might be particularly interested in what Will is doing.


Will's [job market paper](https://github.com/wdu9/JMP/blob/main/JMPDraft.pdf) shows that unemployment scarring ---the well documented micro fact that job loss leads to a permanent decline in wages--- is a key determinant of the speed of macroeconomic recovery following recessions. To be specific, Will demonstrates that these scars capture *both* the shift in the trend of economic growth following the Great Recession and the unaltered trend of economic growth following the pandemic. Will highlights that temporary layoffs played a pivotal role in enabling the swift and complete post-pandemic recovery by preventing unemployment scarring from escalating into macroeconomic scarring through job recalls. More interestingly, combining this finding with the recent work of [Gertler, Huckfeldt, and Trigari. (2022)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30134/w30134.pdf) would suggest that the [*Paycheck Protection Program*](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-programz) supported the swift post-pandemic recovery by encouraging firms to opt for temporary rather than permanent layoffs, thereby mitigating the macroeconomic effects of unemployment scarring. Consequently, Will's job market paper complements the previously mentioned work of Christopher Huckfeldt in the Global Modeling Studies section, especially as Will looks to write a new paper that incorporates the micro-foundations for temporary layoffs developed by Christopher and his co-authors in Will's model from his job market paper to quantify the extent the Paycheck Protection Program mitigated scarring.

%COMMENT
% I don't conduct a Paycheck Protection Program(PPP) counterfactual in which I show the latter. However, I am emphasizing that combining Gertler et al (2022)'s result and my quantitative result that temporary layoffs were a key factor in determining why the recovery returned to pre-2020 trend *suggests* that fiscal policy( the PPP) likely prevented scarring. I plan to write a new paper where I embed Gertler et al (2022)'s search and matching micro foundations into my HANK and SAM to quantitatively assess the extent the PPP reduced scarring. 

%This point on the PPP and how it prevented macro scarring is especially important because Byron Lutz (one of the recipients of this email) has a paper on how the PPP affected employment. I think he would find this point interesting.

Will possesses a strong technical skillset in building and solving general equilibrium heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models that incorporate realistic micro-level consumption behavior. For instance, as my co-author in [*Welfare and Spending Effects of Consumption Stimulus Policies*](https://github.com/llorracc/HAFiscal/blob/master/HAFiscal.pdf), Will developed a HANK model with search and matching frictions to calculate multipliers for unemployment insurance extensions, stimulus checks, and tax cuts. Furthermore, Will has contributed extensively to [HARK](https://docs.econ-ark.org/Documentation/overview/introduction.html), a toolkit for modeling economic decision-making by heterogeneous agents. He has built methods to compute heterogeneous agent Jacobians following the [Sequence Space Jacobian method](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA17434) for solving HANK models. Moreover,  he has authored a [notebook](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/master/examples/ConsNewKeynesianModel/SSJ_example.ipynb) showcasing how HARK integrates with the [Sequence Space Jacobian toolkit](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian) to solve a HANK model. As a result, Will's skillset complements that of [Bence Bardoczy](https://www.bencebardoczy.com/) in the Macroeconomic and Quantitative Studies section who is one of the founders of the Sequence Space Jacobian Method and who specializes in heterogeneous agent macro as Will does.

Will leveraged his technical aptitude for solving HANK models during his internship at the Bank of England to build a HANK model with housing a discrete choice to quantify the housing wealth channel of monetary policy in the United Kingdom ([slides with code](https://github.com/wdu9/HANK_Housing_Block/blob/main/HANK_Housing_Slides%20slides.pdf)). As a result, Will can make a distinctive contribution to the Fed Board by contributing to the development a macroeconomic model that evaluates how monetary policy impacts the transmit through the housing market, especially since housing models that can capture the distributional consequences of monetary policy are rare.  


PPS. I'm attaching the letter I wrote for Will for the application.
