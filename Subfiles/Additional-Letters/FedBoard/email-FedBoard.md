Dear [firstname],

I'm reaching out to you on behalf of my student Will Du ([website](https://www.william-du.com)), who has applied for position of Economist at the Federal Reserve Board, because you're someone who might be particularly interested in what Will is doing.

%If you happened to attend my talk at the R&S 100 conference last fall, you will have seen a sneak preview of Will's JMP in one of my slides. Will shows that in a standard HANK model, the "precautionary multiplier" from the HANK-and-SAM interaction accounts for as much as half of the fluctuations in GDP over the cycle. In his JMP, Will evaluates the macroeconomic consequences of the large persistent earnings loss that follows job displacement on unemployment risk as a business cycle amplifier and in the transmission of unemployment insurance policies.

%His other main project right now involves a HANK-Housing model he had built during his internship at the Bank of England last year (Slides).

%PPS. I'm attaching the letter I wrote for Will for the dissertation fellowship application.
