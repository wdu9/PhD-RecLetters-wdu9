Edmund,

Very pleased to have gotten HAFiscal back to QE on time, and in good shape -- in no small thanks to Will.  He tells me that your section might have an opening, so I'm sending this to you directly.  Also sending to Byron Lutz, Edward Herbst, Gustavo Suarez, Hess Chung, and Jeff Larrimore.  I'd be happy to send to more, but don't want to spam all my many friends at the Fed without specific knowledge of whether their section is hiring.  Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for him. (Boilerplate I'm sending to the others follows).
