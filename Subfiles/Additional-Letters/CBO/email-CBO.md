Dear [firstname],

I'm reaching out to you on behalf of my student Will Du ([website](https://www.william-du.com)),  who is on the Job Market and has applied for the position of Macroeconomist at the Congressional Budget Office, because you're someone who might be particularly interested in what Will is doing.

Will's [job market paper](https://github.com/wdu9/JMP/blob/main/JMPDraft.pdf) shows that unemployment scarring ---the well documented micro fact that job loss leads to a permanent decline in wages--- is a key determinant of the speed of macroeconomic recovery following recessions. To be specific, Will demonstrates that these scars capture *both* the shift in the trend of economic growth following the Great Recession and the unaltered trend of economic growth following the pandemic. Will highlights that temporary layoffs played a pivotal role in enabling the swift and complete post-pandemic recovery by preventing unemployment scarring from escalating into macroeconomic scarring through job recalls. More interestingly, combining this finding with the recent work of [Gertler et al. (2022)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30134/w30134.pdf) suggests that the [*Paycheck Protection Program*](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-programz) supported the swift post-pandemic recovery by encouraging firms to opt for temporary rather than permanent layoffs, thereby mitigating the macroeconomic effects of unemployment scarring. 

%COMMENT
% I am using the words "trend of economic growth" because the CBO website highlights that the Macroeconomic Analysis Division "studies various macroeconomic factors and relationships, such as ... , trends in productivity growth" 
% I don't conduct a Paycheck Protection Program(PPP) counterfactual in which I show the latter. I am just trying to say that combining Gertler et al (2022)'s result and my quantitative result that temporary layoffs were a key factor in determining why the recovery returned to pre-2020 trend *suggests* that fiscal policy( the PPP) likely prevented scarring. I plan to write a new paper where I embed Gertler et al (2022)'s search and matching micro foundations into my HANK and SAM to quantitatively assess the extent the PPP reduced scarring. I also mention this point in the FRB email. It is much more pertinent there. I explain why in the FRB email.


Will possesses expertise in building and solving general equilibrium heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models that incorporate realistic micro-level consumption behavior. This expertise could provide significant value to the fiscal studies unit by enabling precise quantification of fiscal stimulus impacts. For instance, as my co-author in [*Welfare and Spending Effects of Consumption Stimulus Policies*](https://github.com/llorracc/HAFiscal/blob/master/HAFiscal.pdf), Will developed a HANK model with search and matching frictions to calculate multipliers for unemployment insurance extensions, stimulus checks, and tax cuts.

As further evidence of Will's ability, Will has contributed extensively to [HARK](https://docs.econ-ark.org/Documentation/overview/introduction.html), a toolkit for modeling economic decision-making by heterogeneous agents. He has authored a [notebook](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/master/examples/ConsNewKeynesianModel/SSJ_example.ipynb) showcasing how HARK integrates with the [Sequence Space Jacobian toolkit](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian) to solve a HANK model. In fact, this work illustrates how deficit-financed government spending generates significantly larger stimulative effects in a HANK framework compared to TANK or RANK models.




PPS. I'm attaching the letter I wrote for Will for the application.
