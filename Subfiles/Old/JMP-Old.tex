%[Description of JMP and any other relevant work] \\

Will's job market paper evaluates the macroeconomic consequences of the fact that unemployment spells have long-lasting negative effects on labor earnings.  To do so, he builds a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model with search and matching frictions augmented to include human capital dynamics (the assumed channel for the long-lasting effects of unemployment). His model matches the persistent earnings loss following job displacement that is present in the data, the path of IMPCs documented in Norwegian data, and generates distribution of liquid wealth consistent with data from the \textit{Survey of Consumer Finances}. With the model in hand, he shows that precautionary saving in response to heightened unemployment risk is much larger than in existing models. Over the business cycle, he shows that in his model vs existing HANK models, unemployment is a much stronger amplifier of fluctuations and that the automatic-stabilizer effects of UI spring largely from the precautionary channel as opposed to their stimulative effect on income. For longer policy horizons, he finds that extending UI is considerably more stimulative than increasing the UI replacement rate, because UI extension more effectively mitigates the precautionary saving that arises against the possibility of long term unemployment.
