%[Anything student wants CDC to say in conclusion]

Will effectively communicates technically complex concepts in an intuitive manner. Because he is ahead of me in a number of advanced topics in computational methods, I have invited him to give a guest lecture on advanced computational methods in my Ph.D. computational economics course the past two years. Based on his excellent presentations in those lectures and on his friendly and engaging manner, I am confident that he will be a successful and popular teacher.
