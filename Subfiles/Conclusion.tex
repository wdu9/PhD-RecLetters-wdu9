Overall, I strongly recommend William Du for the Federal Reserve Board Dissertation Fellowship for this coming summer. He would be a great fit because his research is closely related to a number of economists at the Federal Reserve Board and he has the experience and skills to be quickly contribute to divisions looking to build and solve housing models of monetary policy.
