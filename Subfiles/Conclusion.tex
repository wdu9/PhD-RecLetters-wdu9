%[Anything student wants CDC to say in conclusion]

Will's work is closely related to the work of Vaishali Garga. In particular, \cite{Garga2021} evaluates optimal monetary policy in the presence of hysteresis. In Will's JMP, he shows that unemployment scarring provides a microfounded explanation for hysteresis. Because unemployment scarring generates large amounts of inequality, the implications of optimal monetary policy may change in the presence of unemployment scarring.


%, in particular Bence Bardoczy, Sebastian Graves, and Christopher Huckfeldt.  \cite{BardoczySpousal} investigates whether spousal insurance would serve as a powerful automatic stabilizer against the effects of countercyclical unemployment risk, while \cite{gravesUrisk} evaluates whether unemployment risk amplifies business cycles. In Will's JMP, he shows that UI extensions are a powerful macro stabilization tool due its expectational transmission and demonstrates that the unemployment risk channel is 2-3 times larger when households are subject persistent earnings losses. In \cite{huckfeldtUscar} finds that unemployment scarring is concentrated on workers who switch occupations and justifies how this scarring can arise in a structural model. While \cite{huckfeldtUscar} studies the causes of unemployment scarring, Will's work studies the consequences of unemployment scarring instead.

Further, Will has both strong interest and experience in solving HANK models with housing as discrete choice. As a PhD intern at the Bank of England, he solved a HANK model which decomposed the components of the housing wealth channel (\href{https://github.com/wdu9/HANK_Housing_Block/blob/main/HANK_Housing_Slides\%20slides.pdf}{Slides}).  Will would make a strong fit in any group looking to build such a model. 

Finally, Will is well versed in the sequence space Jacobian (SSJ) approach to solving HANK models (\cite{absrSSJ}). Both the HANK model in his JMP as well as the housing model at the Bank of England were solved using the SSJ toolkit. Moreover, Will has integrated the SSJ methods into the \href{https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK}{HARK} toolkit by programming methods to produce heterogeneous agent Jacobians with the 'Fake News' Algorithm (\cite{absrSSJ}).
