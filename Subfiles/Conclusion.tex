%[Anything student wants CDC to say in conclusion]

Will can effectively communicate technical complex concepts in an intuitive manner. He has given a guest lecture on advanced computational methods in my Ph.D. computational economics course the past two years. I believe Will can be an effective teacher at Claremont Mckenna, helping students clarify complex economic concepts into intuitive stories.
