%[Things student wants CDC to be sure to say in intro - in particular, a clear explanation of why the position fits their research agenda, and why the institution would have an interest in having someone work on whatever you propose to work on].




%As a result, in his research, Will investigates important questions that are underexplored because they are technically challenging to tackle.

% said something like this in my own intro
% Will's broad research agenda is to understand how evidence and theory from the microeconomic literature can enhance our understanding of macroeconomic dynamics - he is one of the new generation trying to build serious microfoundations for macro.  In pursuit of this, Will has become adept at using advanced computational methods to develop general equilibrium macroeconomic models that can capture rich microeconomic-structural foundations. 

% repeats stuff in JMP.tex
% In his research, Will investigates the implications of a well documented microeconomic fact --that job loss leaves scars on wages-- in stagnating long term growth and the distributional transmission of fiscal policy .
