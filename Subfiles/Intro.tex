The aim of Will's research is to understand how evidence and theory from the microeconomic literature can enhance our understanding of macroeconomic dynamics.  In pursuit of this, Will develops general equilibrium models that can capture rich microeconomic-structural foundations. As a result, in his research, Will has investigated the implications of a well documented microeconomic fact --that job loss leaves scars on wages-- in the  distributional transmission of fiscal policy and stagnating long term growth.
