The aim of Will's research is to understand how evidence and theory from the microeconomic literature can enhance our understanding of macroeconomic dynamics. Consequently, Will has extensive training and experience in analyzing micro panel data (e.g. CPS, SCF, SCE) and in developing general equilibrium models with rich micro-structural foundations. Beyond his technical skills, Will is collaborative and works well on a team. He has spearheaded the development of two papers co-authored with his classmates and regularly seeks input from peers in other fields to gain diverse perspectives on his work.
