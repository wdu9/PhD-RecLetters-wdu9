%[Things student wants CDC to be sure to say in intro - in particular, a clear explanation of why the position fits their research agenda, and why the institution would have an interest in having someone work on whatever you propose to work on].

The broad aim of Will's research is to understand how evidence and theory from the microeconomic literature can inform our understanding of macroeconomic dynamics. Achieving this goal requires mastery of disparate set of tools, including the ability measure the micro facts with micro panel datasets; the skill of figuring out how to match the micro measurements with a structural micro model; and deep understanding of cutting-edge computational/mathematical tools that have been at the root of the recent blossoming of the HA macro literature (because they allow us to compute macroeconomic dynamics consistent with microeconomic realities).

Beyond his technical skills, Will has proven his ability to work well on a team. He has spearheaded the development of two papers co-authored with his classmates and regularly seeks input from peers in other fields (especially applied micro and structural micro) to make sure his understanding of the results of these fields jibes with the perspectives of those most deeply familiar with the relevant literature.
