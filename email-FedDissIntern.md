Draft emails for me to cut and paste

Dear [firstname],

I'm reaching out to you on behalf of my student Will Du, who has applied for a Fed dissertation internship, because you're someone who might be particularly interested in what Will is doing.

If you happened to attend my talk at the R&S 100 conference last fall, you will have seen a sneak preview of Will's JMP [in one of my slides](https://econ-ark.github.io/beyond-the-streetlight/#/9/0/0).  Will shows that in a standard HANK model, the "precautionary multiplier" from the HANK-and-SAM interaction accounts for as much as half of the fluctuations in GDP over the cycle. 

His other main project right now involves a HANK-Housing model he built during his internship at the Bank of England last year ([Slides](https://github.com/wdu9/HANK_Housing_Block/blob/main/HANK_Housing_Slides%20slides.pdf)).

PS. Hope to see you at my visit to the Fed on Weds!

PPS. I'm attaching the letter I wrote for Will for the dissertation internship application.
