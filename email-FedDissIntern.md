Draft emails for me to cut and paste

Dear [firstname],

I'm reaching out to you on behalf of my student Will Du, who has applied for a Fed dissertation internship, because you're someone who might be particularly interested in what Will is doing.

If you happened to attend my talk at the R&S 100 conference last fall, you will have seen a sneak preview of Will's JMP [in one of my slides](https://econ-ark.github.io/beyond-the-streetlight/#/9/0/0).  Will shows that in a standard HANK model, the "precautionary multiplier" from the HANK-and-SAM interaction accounts for as much as half of the fluctuations in GDP over the cycle. 

His other main project right now involves incorporating a model of housing in a HANK model, building on a project he pursued during his internship at the Bank of England last year.

PS. Hope to see you at my visit to the Fed on Weds!

PPS. I'm attaching the letter I wrote for Will for the dissertation internship application.
